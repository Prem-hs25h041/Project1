📊 User Behaviour Analysis – Mobile Usage Dataset

This project analyzes smartphone user behavior patterns using a structured dataset of 700 users.
If you're serious about understanding digital consumption patterns instead of just plotting random charts, this dataset gives you enough depth to extract meaningful insights.

🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to:

Identify patterns in mobile usage behavior

Segment users into behavioral classes

Understand correlations between:

Screen time and battery drain

App usage and data consumption

Device type and usage intensity

Build analytical dashboards for insight visualization

If you only look at averages, you’ll miss the story. The value lies in relationships between variables.

📊 Pivot Analysis

The Pivot analysis sheet summarizes:

Usage trends by operating system

Behavioral class distributions

Age vs usage patterns

Device-based usage comparison

This is where trends become visible instead of buried in raw data.

📈 Dashboard

The Dashboard sheet provides visual insights including:

App usage distribution

Screen time segmentation

Behavioral class breakdown

OS comparison
