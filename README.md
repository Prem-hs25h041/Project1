##  Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Identify patterns in mobile usage behavior  
- Segment users into behavioral classes  
- Analyze correlations between:
  - Screen time and battery drain  
  - App usage and data consumption  
  - Device type and usage intensity  
- Build analytical dashboards for insight visualization  

The real value lies in understanding relationships between variables, not just computing averages.

##  Pivot Analysis

The **Pivot analysis** sheet summarizes:

- Usage trends by operating system  
- Behavioral class distributions  
- Age vs usage patterns  
- Device-based usage comparison  

This layer transforms raw data into interpretable trends.

##  Dashboard

The **Dashboard** sheet provides visual insights including:

- App usage distribution  
- Screen time segmentation  
- Behavioral class breakdown  
- OS comparison
